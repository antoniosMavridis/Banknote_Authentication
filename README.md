## Introduction
Banknotes are a type of negotiable promissory note and are one of the most significant assets of a country. The financial market is being victimized by criminals who make counterfeit banknotes and introduce them into the financial system. For the human eye, the right choice between fictitious and genuine banknotes is almost impossible. This is the reason why we need machine learning techniques. Data analysis helps to address the problem. This paper proposes machine learning techniques to evaluate authentication of banknotes. Supervised learning algorithms and classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to differentiate genuine counterfeit banknotes. The study also shows the comparison of these methods in classification of banknotes. </br>

Machine learning is a field of study and is concerned with algorithms that learn from examples. Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. Classification predictive modeling algorithms are evaluated based on their results. There are different types of classification methods ones which is called Binary. Binary Classification refers to those classification tasks that have two class labels. Typically, binary classification tasks involve one class that is the normal state and another class that is the abnormal state. The class for the normal state is assigned the class label 0 and the class with the abnormal state is assigned the class label 1. The most popular algorithms that can be used for binary classification are: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes. Some algorithms are specifically designed for binary classification such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. We use this idea to address the banknote classification task. The problem of identifying a currency as fake or real is a classification problem, which aims at the automatic separation of counterfeit banknotes from genuine ones. The study aims to train classifiers using a training set that enables the underlying algorithm to closely approximate a mathematical function that would have generated the labels of the training data. This helps classifiers to classify a test data point for which the class label is to be found. In other words, this technique finds the solution to our problem.

## Data Set Description
The dataset used to train the models is taken from UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication. Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images. The features were extracted from the images after subjecting them to wavelet transform and the extracted features are Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis and Entropy. The dataset consists of just these four features and class labels. The dataset was conceived to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine banknotes. The dataset has 1372 instances. The target class contains two values: 0 and 1 where 0 represents genuine note and 1 represents fake note. </br>
